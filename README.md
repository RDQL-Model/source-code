This project provides the software of the Reaction-Diffusion model using Q-Learning (RDQL). Please add the library file "patternmodel.jar" to your java project, and run the file "TuringPatternModel.java". All the parameters can be set in the main function. The low dimensional vector representation and high dimensional topology representation of the generated networks are saved in the path ".\files\test\public". If you have any question about this software, please contact Dong Li (dongli@sdu.edu.cn).
